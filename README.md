# polymer-length-distibution
A MATLAB ode model to calculate length distibutions of nucleating and elongating polymer filaments (like F-actin)


To test, first load pol_data.mat into the variables R and t

Then you can run pl_example, which will just plot the pyrene assay simulation for a preselected set of parameters along with the real data.

If you want to try fitting, run pl_fitting, which will calculate the pyrene assay simulation over and over trying to find the right parameters.  (This will take a long time.)
